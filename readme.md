WordPress plugin to import BlogML format
=========
I needed this to move blog to WordPress from arcane dasBlog engine. I found the original script  [here](http://www.kavinda.net/content/other/BlogML-WordPress-Import.zip). From what I read in [this](http://www.craigbailey.net/migrating-from-blogengine-net-to-wordpress/) blog post, it was created by [Aaron Lerch](http://www.aaronlerch.com/blog/) but readme says otherwise so I'm not too sure.

Original code didn't support importing tags from BlogML format - it was simply ignoring them. I added some PHP code to support tags import, the same way categories were handled.
